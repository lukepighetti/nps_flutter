# NPS Flutter

This is a collection of surveys that I am using to try to drill down on the ideal stack for solo[^1] development of Flutter apps for production and business.

## Surveys

## Results

I discuss results on Twitter as [@luke_pighetti](https://twitter.com/luke_pighetti), but I would like to find a way to publish here.

Dealing with these surveys is more complicated than one might imagine and requires manual classification for each response.

Idea seeds for future surveys

- Animations / Interactivity
- App Store optimization (ASO / Play Store)
- Asset / Environment Flavors (.env files, launcher, name, assets)
- Backend integration (REST/RPC/WebSockets)
- Celebrations (confetti / Lottie)
- Code velocity (deploy scripts, // TODO product development, "Jira" google sheets, BFF stacks, high ownership)
- Deeplinking
- Dependency injection
- Dev tools screen [example](https://twitter.com/SebastianRoehl/status/1671885451324723201)
- Dialogs / In-app Notifications
- Feature flags
- Feedback product loop (customer driven product)
- Growth (contact SMS mass invites, referrals, trickle invite codes)
- Hardware integrations (camera/bluetooth)
- Internationalisation (separate from localisation)
- Kill switch (for old versions)
- Local mock API data
- Localization
- On-device storage
- Platform/Device Services (Camera, GPS, Compass, Media controls, BLE, etc etc)
- Platforms (iOS / Android)
- Push notifications
- Quality Control (testing, customer care, error telemetry)
- Revenue (IAP)
- Routing
- Sounds
- State management
- Telemetry
- Tests
- Theming (dark/light mode)
- UI framework / components
- Whitelabelling
