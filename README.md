# NPS Flutter

This is a collection of surveys that I am using to try to drill down on the ideal stack for solo development of Flutter apps for production and business.[^1]

## Surveys

- [State Management](https://forms.gle/QrZThXApMRxfZiNL8)
- [Backend](https://forms.gle/ED7oZQJWgbS1kCEH7)

## Results

I discuss results on Twitter as [@luke_pighetti](https://twitter.com/luke_pighetti), but I would like to find a way to publish here.

Dealing with these surveys is more complicated than one might imagine and requires manual classification for each response.

## Roadmap

- Animations / Interactivity
- App Store optimization (ASO / Play Store)
- Asset / Environment Flavors (.env files, launcher, name, assets)
- Backend integration (REST/RPC/WebSockets)
- Celebrations (confetti / Lottie)
- Code velocity (deploy scripts, // TODO product development, "Jira" google sheets, BFF stacks, high ownership)
- Deeplinking
- Dependency injection
- Dialogs / In-app Notifications
- Feature flags
- Feedback product loop (customer driven product)
- Growth (contact SMS mass invites, referrals, trickle invite codes)
- Hardware integrations (camera/bluetooth)
