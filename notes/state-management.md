## Riverpod

### What could be improved?

- Documentation is lacking
- Too magic box
  - *Matthew* If you don't worry about it, it's fine
- Caching system could persist
  - *Luke* HydratedStateNotifier
  - *Matthew* save/load mixin
- API duplication
  - *Matthew* lots of providers not in use  
    only use StateNotifierProvider
- Have to extend ConsumerWidget
  - *Matthew* can use linter with auto refactor to convert widgets
  

### What do you like about it?

### Speaker points

- *Matthew* Super opinionated capitalist ecosystems (like Vercel) solve some problems but create others
- *Matthew* Flutter Web is great for cranking out MVPs
- *Matthew* Web first with deeplink architecture makes for a robust app
  - *Luke* go_router
- *Luke* "Just use StateNotifier" in `riverpod` might be similar to "Just use Cubit" in `flutter_bloc`
- *Danielle* Riverpod is a data fetching solution, not so much a state management solution
